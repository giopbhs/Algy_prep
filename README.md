# NB RUBY Algorithm Meetup!

so to make this straight forward... this repository has backend questions, frontend questions,  general questions, and algoritm questions.

I would reccomend letting your parner choose what they would like to practice. Some might only want to practice algorithms, if that's the case go onto the the algoritm folder. 

If you don't know where to start, I'd go with general questions, then moving towards some frontend or backend, then Algorithms.

## If you decide to do some algorithms...

Use a repl!

^^^ this has many languages to choose from on the web.
